## Github integration

We have a test organization for debugging issues, related with github.

[https://github.com/bootcamp-test](https://github.com/bootcamp-test)

To manage it, you can use `opensource@howtohireme.ru` account.

In order to call APIs, you need to obtain a personal access token here: `https://github.com/settings/tokens`, using previously provided GitHub account.
Alternatively you can ask @mehonoshin for already existing token.
